### Welcome to the Tetracube project - TETRA³
###### [MetaLabs](https://metalabs.org.uk) - Where the FUN happens
----------------------------------------
The platform that I am building, is unique in the way I've developed it. Hopefully it will bring to the public, a fully functional
cryptographic platform, one where the control of personal data, is yours and yours alone.  
  
I've currently set this project to **CLOSED SOURCE**, this is until I'm fully happy with the encrpytion system.

You can follow the early development via [MetaLabs](https://metalabs.org.uk)
