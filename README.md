# MetaCubic [Meta続] Network
### Meta続Network
For over 20 years, I've been learning various technologies. I've started from the ground and worked my way up, to now being able to build in several different languages.  
  
I've learned the hardware, how to build it, how to maintain it and what softwares work best.  
  
I've then learned the middleware between hardware and software, understanding how operating systems work, networks, communications and various other ways of connecting with the world.  
  
I've then learned some of the software behind web technologies, [NodeJS](), [NestJS](), [ExpressJS](), [AngularJS]() and some other older stuff, that I learned at a young age **[Basic(80's Variant)]**.  
  
I've now come to learning **System Lanaguages**, [C++]() and [RUST](). I'm learning RUST, as I'm also learning the [Near]() Protocol. However in order to develop the Meta続Network, I need to learn C++ as well, as my intention is to bring a new concept to **Cryptography**, though I say new, it isn't new, but it is a concept not being used and most likely will never be used in the way it is currently thought about.  
  
There are various other technologies I've learned, [Docker]() and [Kurbnetes](), just to name two.  
  
So that's a bit about me and the project, more will be in the **Meta続 Whitepaper** when released.
