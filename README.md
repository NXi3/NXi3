# MetaCubic [Meta³] Network
### Meta³Network
For over 20 years, I've been learning various technologies. I've started from the ground and worked my way up, to now being able to build in several different languages.  
  
I've learned the hardware, how to build it, how to maintain it and what softwares work best.  
  
I've then learned the middleware between hardware and software, understanding how operating systems work, networks, communications and various other ways of connecting with the world.  
  
I've then learned some of the software behind web technologies, [NodeJS](), [NestJS](), [ExpressJS](), [AngularJS]() and some other older stuff, that I learned at a young age **[Basic(80's Variant)]**.
